CSE508 Network Security, Fall 2017

Homework 3: Plugboard Proxy

Submitted by: Shalaka Sidmul


Introduction:
-------------
Pbproxy adds an extra layer of protection to publicly accessible network services.
It facilitates encrypted communication between client and server using symmetric key.
The encryption prevents attacks such as zero day vulnerability [e.g. Heartbleed in OpenSsl]

Implementation details:
-----------------------
The client application connects to the proxy and sends data encrypted using the symmetric key.
The proxy on the server side decrypts the data sent by client and forwards it to the upstream server.
If the data is tampered/ not encrypted properly, it will be discarded and will not reach the upstream server.
This protects the upstream server 

The Plugboard Proxy functions in two modes: 
	1. client mode
	2. server mode

Client mode:
	1. Connect to server side proxy 
	2. read user commands from STDIN (console)
	3. encrypt user input using supplied symmetric key with AES in Counter mode with 128 bit key
	4. send encrypted data to server side proxy
	5. read reply from server side proxy
	6. decrypt reply received with AES in Counter mode with 128 bit key
	7. write decrypted reply to STDOUT (console)

Server mode:
	1. Listen for connection requests from clients.
	2. accept a request, create a thread to handle messages from that client.
	3. each thread for client,
		3.a makes a connection to destination server (sshd)
		3.b reads messages from client
		3.c decrypts messages from client using supplied symmetric key with AES in Counter mode with 128 bit key
		3.d sends the decrypted message to upstream server.
		3.e reads reply from upstream server
		3.f encrypts reply from upstream server using supplied symmetric key with AES in Counter mode with 128 bit key
		3.g sends encrypted reply to client


This project has the following files:
-------------------------------------
	1. MakeFile
	2. keygen.c : for generating symmetric key
	3. pbproxy.c : for reading the arguments and initializing the key proxy in proper mode. (server, client)
	4. serverProxy.h : implementation of proxy in server mode
	5. clientProxy.h : implementation of proxy in client mode
	6. keyfile : a sample key file

Commands for running the Plugboard proxy setup:
-----------------------------------------------
	1. create a key   :	./keygen -k <name_of_key_file>     	
	
	   creates random key and store it in file with name specified after option '-k-
	   You can use the sample key file with this project : keyfile

	2. start proxy in	:	./pbproxy -l <listen_port> -k <name_of_key_file> <service_host> <service_port>	
   	   server mode

	   Starts proxy in server mode. 
	   The proxy will listen for client requests on port <listen_port>.
           It will forward only the correctly decrypted requests to service at <service_host:service_port>

	3. start proxy in client mode	:	ssh -o "ProxyCommand ./pbproxy -k <name_of_key_file> <server_name> <port> " localhost
